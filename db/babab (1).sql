You’ll find many lists of Bill Gates’s recommendations online.\r\n\r\nBut I stumbled on a goldmine. He’s tracked 233 books and of all these only four received top marks. He’s a harsh critic with Yuval Noah Hariri’s 21 Lessons For The 21st Century earning only 3 stars.\r\n\r\nThey are all about how to make this world a better place and align with his philanthropy through the Melinda Gates Foundation. If you want to think like Bill Gates, read more about the world and less about how to make money.\r\n\r\nI’ve read the exclusive books before and cannot question the inspiration and education they provide. If you haven’t yet, I hope you read these books and expand your mind.\r\nEnlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress by Steven Pinker\r\n\r\nBill Gates ended his review by calling this book his “new favorite book of all time”. Steven Pinker is a multiple-time best-seller but there’s no way he isn’t bragging about that to his grandkids.\r\n\r\nIt’s broken down into 15 chapters about different measures of progress throughout history. These build a compelling case that now is the best time to be alive. The news bombards us with what’s wrong in society so we rarely appreciate what is right. I’d never trade my life for one at any other time.\r\n\r\nOne stat Bill highlights is: “Time spent doing laundry fell from 11.5 hours a week in 1920 to an hour and a half in 2014”. People sometimes crave a return to a simpler life but would you want to trade 10 hours of your life for laundry? Shifts like this in the last century have helped free women from the shackles of domestic labor.\r\n\r\nSteven never suggests society is perfect but seeing how much progress we’ve made can give us hope and the motivation to keep going. Within my lifetime, I’ve especially seen the incredible enlightenment in how mental illnesses are viewed.\r\nEducated By Tara Westover\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful story of a woman who overcame extreme odds through education. Bill admits her “ability to learn on her own blows” him right out of the water.\r\n\r\nTara’s father held toxic views about the progress of modern society and stopped his children from going to school. One of her brothers physically and psychologically abused her throughout her childhood. When Tara finally told her parents, they accused her of being a liar possessed by Satan.\r\n\r\nWith this upbringing, it’s almost unbelievable she scored high enough on the ACT to win a scholarship to college through self-study. And she went despite the violent protests from her family. She graduated with honors then was awarded a Gates Scholarship to attend the University of Cambridge for her Masters and Ph.D.\r\n\r\nTara would have seemed naive and stupid to most at 16. Her transformation is a crushing blow for those who believe anyone is a lost hope. When we have access to opportunities that others don’t, how can we look down on them?
